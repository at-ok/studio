// Potentially reuse RouteData from firestoreService.ts or define a client-specific version here.
// For now, we'll rely on the types defined within each component and the firestoreService.
// If the application grows, centralizing types here would be beneficial.

// Example:
// export interface ClientRoute {
//   id: string;
//   title: string;
//   description: string;
//   // ... other fields
//   createdAt: string; // Use string for client-side dates
// }

// This file can remain empty or be removed if types are managed locally within components/services.
export {}; // Ensure file is treated as a module
